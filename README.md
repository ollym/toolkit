# ECMA5 Multi-Purpose Javascript Toolkit
Documentation is at: http://jstoolkit.org

## Features
* Emulates ECMA5 Object features in legacy browsers. http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-objects-and-properties/
* Over 86 native object prototypes extensions.
* Fully portable and tested on multiple platforms.

## Design Philosophy
* Written in pure optimised javascript.
* Use JST methods within JST wherever possible.
* Lightweight, fast and small. Suitable for mobile devices.

## Avoided
* Overlapping frameworks like JQuery, Prototype etc.
* Full i18n / l10n compatibility. Although 90% of JST methods are locale-independent, JST is english-only.
* Monolithic code-base and be-all-and-end-all integrated library.

## Installation and Getting Started

### Browser
If you plan to use JSToolkit in the browser it is advised that you link `jst.min.js` in a script tag in your header. You can find `jst.min.js` in the `dist/` folder of this repository or from the website jstoolkit.org and click the download button.

### Node.JS / NPM
Using JSToolkit in Node.JS is incredibly easy. Simply install the package using a simple command:

    npm install toolkit -g

And to setup the integrated methods simply put `require('toolkit')` anywhere within your script.

#### Node.JS REPL
Because of the way Node.JS's REPL works, you cannot use toolkit as you would normally so we have provided a special integrated repl that works with JSToolkit.

    $ node
    > require('toolkit').repl();
    toolkit> Array.range(1,9,3);
    [ 1, 4, 7 ]
    
## Goals & Features
The JS Toolkit has very specific goals - as to not re-invent the wheel. They go as follows:

* Complete Unit-Test coverage.
* Designed entirely for ECMA5 applications - Node.JS/V8 specifically.
* Performance is key and is achieved through elegance and simplicity.
* ECMA5 introduced a number of new Object definition descriptors which must be respected.
* Eases development by extending type prototypes safely. Object.prototype is left untouched.
* Use accelerated native functions and fully embrace the new ECMA5 specification.

## Contributing
Please follow the following steps to contributing.

1. Check whether an issue containing your fix/feature is already open, if not create one.
2. Fork the JSToolkit repository and create a branch for fix. Like `feature/Array#foobar` or `bugfix/Array#diff`
3. Make all commits relating to your issue to that branch and once ready put it into a pull request referencing the issue.
4. Be sure to include full unit-tests for your change and ensure they pass! We use QUnit as our testing framework.
